# Stock_Price_Prediction_using_LSTM_and_GRU

This project aim to develop a machine learning model to predict the future stock prices. I used an LSTM model to achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of under
0.01 on the AAPL stock price dataset. The [report](./report.pdf) provides an overview of the dataset and the exploratory data analysis conducted, as well as 
the model training and calibration process. I also conducted an ablation study to evaluate the effect of various configurations on the modelâ€™s performance.
